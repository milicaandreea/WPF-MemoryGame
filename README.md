#  MemoryGame-WPF

A fully interactive memory card game developed in **WPF and C#**, following the **MVVM architectural pattern**. The application allows users to register with profile pictures, play standard or custom board games, save and resume game state, and track gameplay statistics. Gameplay is time-limited and image-based, with a dynamic board and real-time tile matching logic.
